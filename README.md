### IDEA

Probably can't use nextjs

each game will have a viewer page that can be shown on the TV
  - catchphrase can show the current score and category and teams 
  - host chooses how many lives each person has


player page picks what game to play?  or maybe can join the game that is being hosted?


- catchphrase will be a single player game? could vibrate each persons phone when it's their word. timer on tv


each game will have a player setup:
  - first page: create a user
  - second page: waiting lobby
  - third page: start game
